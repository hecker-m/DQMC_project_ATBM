# DQMC_project_ATBM
A DQMC project based on the (attractive two-band model---ATBM) Hamiltonian introduced in https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.247001. First, I reproduce their results finding a Neel state. Later, I choose a Fermi surface which favors a degenerate magnetic ground state, which I investigate with respect of all sorts of bilinear orders.

The implementation is based on the `MonteCarlo.jl` package, which I modified slightly. 

Research in progress.
