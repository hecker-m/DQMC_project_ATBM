# Heisenberg_Striped
In this DQMC project, I investigate a twofold degenerate magnetic striped ground state with respect to fluctuation-induced bilinear order (nematic, A_1^\prime double-Q). 

TODO: be more specific

The DQMC framework is based on the `MonteCarlo.jl` package, which has been slightly modified to allow both, discrete and continuous field implementation.

This repository is work in progress.
