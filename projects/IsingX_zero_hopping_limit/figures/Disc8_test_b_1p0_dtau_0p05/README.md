# IsingX_Striped in the zero hopping limit

These figures where taken for the Discretized field with 8 stable points Disc8,
where the four most centric ones are promoted. For reassurance, we measured here without including the transition probability matrix T0.
Just as expected, one finds a clear deviation from the correct result, demonstrating the importance of the correct transition probability matrix T0.
